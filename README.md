# planterbracket
A 3d printable bracket for holding planter boxes on a fence.

  This was made in response to a problem I've been having, In my limited patio space, the fence blocks the sunlight for part of the day to any planters placed on the ground. These brackets solve this problem and cost around $1 per bracket. I have had luck holding up planter boxes with two of them. I have been using three per box, though, for safety's sake. I have not been using them with screws. However, 1/4 inch screw holes are included in the model should you wish to use them.

***Here are the dimensions of the bracket, make sure they work with your fence before printing, or resize it to your liking:***

***Here are the printer settings I used, this takes about 6 hours to print on my LK5 Pro.***

  If you are having issues with strength, try printing with a higher infill density.
