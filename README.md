# planterbracket
A 3d printable bracket for holding planter boxes on a fence.

This was made in response to a problem I've been having where, in my limited patio space, the fence blocks the sunlight for part of the day to any planters placed on the ground. These brackets solve this problem and cost around 50c to print per bracket. I have had luck holding up planter boxes with two of them, however I have been using three per box for safety's sake. I have not been using them with screws, however 1/4 inch screw holes are included in the model should you wish to use them.
